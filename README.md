This repository contains the complete data and code for the study entitled "Large Language Model Predicting the Corrosion Inhibition Efficiency Based on Table Embeddings for Small Datasets."

File Structure
Code files: 5 independent code scripts (named A–E), corresponding to different experimental groups.
Data files: 2 datasets, with the E-related dataset being the pre-computed table embedding data (containing raw embedding vectors).

Data Source
The original datasets are derived from Lamaka et al. (DOI: 10.1038/s41529-023-00391-0). Please cite this reference when using the data in your research.

Key Notes on Embedding Data
The pre-computed embedding dataset (E) is provided for convenience: it contains raw embedding vectors generated by the Qwen (Tongyi Qianwen) large language model API. This dataset allows direct use of the embedding features without the need for separate API access/purchase.

LLM API Information
The table embeddings in this study are generated using the Qwen (通义千问) large language model API.
